In this workshop we will learn to use the JavaScript APIs from the HERE Location Suite.

The Step by Step will show you how, in a fill steps, you may find a place to eat or (in these pandemia times) pickup your food nearby.

It is simple but shows you how easy it is to use HERE solutions and how you can build something more robust with your own knowledge without paying or even inserting your credit card number ;)

Each Step has all documentation related to it.

I suggest you see this 100DaysOfCode Challenge to get to know other solutions and possibilities: https://github.com/kuberaspeaking/100DaysOfCodeWithHERE
